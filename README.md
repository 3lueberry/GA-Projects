Project #1: Code Avengers | the RPG for coders ##
</h3>


## What is Code Avengers? ## 🤔
**Code Avengers** is a fun Simulation RPG based on the daily life of a tech student.
Learn coding while playing this engaging game.
- JavaScript Syntax
- HTML structures
- CSS animations and many more...
- But don't overdo yourself
- Watch out your health and rest well if you need to.
- Eat and drink properly to recharge your energy.
- And continue training both your mind and body to become a fit Coder.

## How is it developed? ## 🧑🏻‍💻
- A responsive layout with auto self-aligning buttons with the use of CSS variables.
- Unclusttered HTML structures with the help of JS DOM manipulations.
- Mixed use of Vanilla / jQuery and custom function for better controls (each for their own tasks)
- Event Listeners played a big part while using minium listeners to avoid multiple codes and inputs.
- Dynamically loading both HTML and JavaScript coded in multiple files in proper and module structured style.
- Optimised all images and icons for more responsive loading.
- Lastly, using Local Storage for saved game.

## Unfinished Business ## 🏗
- Storyline has not been added.
- Only 3 locations available for playing; 
- - Index.nacle, a place to rest 🏠
- - Await Yoga, train your mind 🧘‍♀️
- - Nested-ball Court, shoot fast, shoot right 🏀
- Other locations including the School and Food places has not been coded.
- There doesn't seem to have any issue so far, however.

## Difficulties ## 🚧
- Designing a game with responsive layout using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts is unimaginably hard.
- Getting CSS positioning right took most of the time available.
