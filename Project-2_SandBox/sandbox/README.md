### Unfinished Business 🏗

```
- User Profile
- Connect others
- 1-to-1 messaging
- End-to-end encription
- Oauth aunthentication
- And other features to be develop in the future
```

### API used

**Firebase Firestore NoSQL DB**

```
Axios GET: Fetch rooms list and messages
Axios POST: Create User and send new messages
Axios PATCH: Record and Edit Pinned messages
Axios Delete: Delete messages
```

### Difficulties 🚧

```
- Firbase REST API does not allow push update
- Setting right fetch timing from right place was tedious

```
